            <h3>My experience attending a Coding Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>While attending the bootcamp at <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com" style="color: yellow;">Coding Dojo</a> they taught us 3 stacks for full CRUD web development. This was a Full-time program requiring 8-10 hours a day on average. A typical day would start with an algorithm session where we would break into small groups to tackle a new coding challenge each day. The challenges they assigned always required us to think outside the box and collaborate with the other cohorts in our group. This was good for team building as well as thinking how to break the problem down into manageable chunks. We started with the stack of Python, Flask, and MySQL. We spent a month on each stack, doing the course work assigned</p>
